# Operator	Name	Example	Try it
# +	Addition	x + y	
# -	Subtraction	x - y	
# *	Multiplication	x * y	
# /	Division	x / y	
# %	Modulus	x % y	
# **	Exponentiation	x ** y	
# //	Floor division	x // y	







# Python Assignment Operators
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

# Operator	Example	Same As	Try it
# =	x = 5	x = 5	
# +=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
# -=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
# *=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
# /=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
# %=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
# //=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
# **=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	
# &=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
# |=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
# ^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
# >>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
# <<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3






# Python Comparison Operators
# Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

# Operator	Name	Example	Try it
# ==	Equal	x == y	
# !=	Not equal	x != y	
# >	Greater than	x > y	
# <	Less than	x < y	
# >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
# <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y




# Python Identity Operators
# Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

# Operator	Description	Example	Try it
# is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y	
# is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y
# Python Membership Operators
# Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:






# Operator	Description	Example	Try it
# in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	x in y	
# not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y
# Python Bitwise Operators
# Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:



# Operator	Name	Description	Example	Try it
# & 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1	x & y	
# |	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1	x | y	
# ^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1	x ^ y	
# ~	NOT	Inverts all the bits	~x	
# <<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off	x << 2	
# >>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off	x >> 2




# Operator	Description	Try it
# ()	Parentheses	
# **	Exponentiation	
# +x  -x  ~x	Unary plus, unary minus, and bitwise NOT	
# *  /  //  %	Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus	
# +  -	Addition and subtraction	
# <<  >>	Bitwise left and right shifts	
# &	Bitwise AND	
# ^	Bitwise XOR	
# |	Bitwise OR	
# ==  !=  >  >=  <  <=  is  is not  in  not in 	Comparisons, identity, and membership operators	
# not	Logical NOT	
# and	AND	
# or	OR	
# If two operators have the same precedence, the expression is evaluated from left to right.

# Example
# Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence, and therefor we evaluate the expression from left to right:
